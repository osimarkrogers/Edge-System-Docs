Configure data selection using REST

OPC UA connectivity requires a JSON file, for example called OpcUa_DataSelection.json, which includes parameters as described in the following table: 
<Table: Configuration Parameters for OPC UA data selection>
	
The schema file OpcUa.DataSelection.Schema.json specifies how to formally describe the data selection parameters for OPC UA connectivity. It is located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramFiles%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Schema
•	Linux: /opt/EdgeSystem/Schema
	
•	The OPC UA connectivity automatically retrieves changes to the DataSelection.json file and will then begin collecting data for selected variables.
•	Auto-detection of configuration changes might not work correctly with every text editor, for example with the default text editor on an Ubuntu distribution. Use a text editor such as nano or LibreOffice Writer or restart the OPC UA connectivity to apply the changes.

In addition to the data source configuration, you need to provide a data selection configuration to specify the data you want the OPC UA connectivity to collect from the data sources.

1. If this is the first time that you are configuring data selection for this component, create a JSON file and save it to any location.
The file naming schema is ComponentId_DataSelection.json
2. 	
Open the file and provide or modify the parameters with values as shown in this example:

[ { "Selected": true, "Name": "Random1", "NodeId": "ns=5;s=Random1", "StreamId": "CustomStreamName" }, { "Selected": false, "Name": "Sawtooth1", "NodeId": "ns=5;s=Sawtooth1", "StreamId": null }, { "Selected": true, "Name": "Sinusoid1", "NodeId": "ns=5;s=Sinusoid1", "StreamId": null } ]

3. 	
Save and copy the file to all the devices that are running Edge System.
4. 	
Use any REST client and make a request using the following:
•	Method: POST
•	Endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/OpcUa1/DataSelection
•	Header: Content-Type application/json
•	Body: OpcUa_DataSelection.json
Example using curl:

curl -v -d "@OpcUa_DataSelection.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/OpcUa1/DataSelection

For more information on REST routes, see REST request reference.

HTTP status 204 indicates a successful transaction and OPC UA data selection is configured.
